# Hello, world!

The title of this repository is rather deceptive. Even though this repo does
contain `Hello, world!` functionality, it is rather a collection of small and 
heavily documented Rust projects. The goal of these is for me to experiment with
Rust and teach myself (and perhaps you, the reader, as well) Rust!

# Running

root folder.
